# Factory Method Pattern
Define the interface to create the object, however let the subclass decide which class to instantiate.

In this example the ```Factory``` class has the virtual ```create()``` which is implemented by the ```ToyFactory```.
Later, the ```main.cxx``` uses this concrete factory to make the objects.
